# Draw.io Models

This directory contains the **CIM and PIM models** created with **diagrams.net (draw.io)** using the custom libraries developed for the MDD4CPS process.  
The libraries themselves are available in the repository under the `scratchpads/` directory.

## Contents

### Canonical Reference Models
- **`CIM_temp_control_eng.drawio`**  
  Canonical CIM model of the temperature control case study, created with the iStar 2.0 library.  
- **`PIM_temp_control_eng.xml`**  
  Canonical PIM model of the same case study, obtained through model transformation.  
  These two files together represent the **reference baseline** (error-free).

### Faulty Models (Structural Errors)
The remaining files introduce deliberate structural errors of **types 1, 2, and 3** (with variants) as described in the chapter:

- **Type 1 — Two refinement operators in one action**  
  - `CIM_temp_control_err1.drawio`  
  - `PIM_temp_control_err1.xml`

- **Type 2 — Element in two components**  
  - `CIM_temp_control_err2.1.drawio`  
  - `PIM_temp_control_err2.1.xml`  
  - `CIM_temp_control_err2.2.drawio`  
  - `PIM_temp_control_err2.2.xml`  
  - `CIM_temp_control_err2.3.drawio`  
  - `PIM_temp_control_err2.3.xml`

- **Type 3 — Resource typed simultaneously as HW and SW**  
  - `CIM_temp_control_err3.drawio`  
  - `PIM_temp_control_err3.xml`

## Relation to Semantic Validations

- The **CIM models** (`.drawio`) were built with diagrams.net and the iStar library.  
- The **PIM models** (`.xml`) were automatically generated by transformations from their CIM counterparts.  
- Errors present in the CIM models were propagated to the corresponding PIM models.  
- These faulty PIM models served as the **basis for their semantic versions** (`.ttl`) located in  
  `semantics/Structural_validations/`, where they were validated with Protégé + HermiT.

## Purpose

This directory provides the **graphical source models** used to illustrate how structural errors at the CIM level propagate to the PIM stage, and how such errors can later be detected using semantic validation.  
Together with the canonical reference model, they constitute the modeling evidence that supports the validation cases described in the chapter.
